# Daily Food Intake Tracker

> Because great code requires great fuel

A gamified Solana blockchain program that helps developers build consistent, healthy eating habits through rewards and streak tracking.


## The Problem

> Let's be real for a second...

How many times have you done this?

Skipped breakfast because you were "in the zone" debugging
Worked through lunch because "just one more feature"
Realized it's 9 PM and you haven't eaten anything substantial
Survived on coffee and snacks while shipping that critical update


If you're nodding your head right now, you're not alone.


We've all been there. The cycle of ignore food → work harder → feel exhausted → code quality drops → repeat is something developers know all too well. We prioritize our work, our deadlines, and our projects... but somehow, we forget the most basic thing: feeding ourselves.

It's not because we don't care. It's because:

We lose track of time when we're coding
We think "I'll eat after this task" (spoiler: we don't)
We don't realize how much it's affecting our performance
There's no immediate feedback or accountability

The result? Burnout, decreased productivity, health issues, and a general feeling of running on empty.

## The Solution

What if eating regularly could be as satisfying as merging a perfect PR?
That's where the Daily Food Intake Tracker comes in. It's not another boring calorie counter or meal planner that you'll abandon after three days. It's a gamified, blockchain-powered accountability system that actually makes you want to eat regularly.
Here's how it works:

### Gamification That Actually Works

Log your meals, earn points - Simple as that. Breakfast, lunch, dinner = points in your wallet
Build streaks - Complete all 3 meals daily and watch your streak grow (just like your GitHub contribution graph, but healthier)
Unlock milestone rewards - 7 days, 30 days, 100 days... each comes with bonus points and bragging rights
See your progress - A dashboard that shows you're taking care of yourself, one meal at a time


### The Real Goal
This isn't about being perfect. It's about building a habit. It's about:

- Creating awareness of your eating patterns
- Building consistency (not perfection)
- Making self-care feel rewarding
- Proving to yourself that you can prioritize your health alongside your code

Because at the end of the day, the best code is written by well-fed developers.


## User Story

- As a user as should be able to connect my wallet address
- As a user I should be able to see my stats, total points and streak and daily graph
- As a user I should be able to click a button to register a meal
- As a user I should not be able to register more than three meal daily (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)
- As a user I should be able to see the days I missed
